Jane Street Market Forcasting

In this project, I built a machine learning model to solve a real-world problem inspired by the challenges faced by Jane Street in trading financial markets. The dataset provided closely mirrors the data used by Jane Street for their automated trading strategies. My goal was to construct a model capable of predicting key outcomes that are critical for making trading decisions.

The dataset includes anonymized and lightly obfuscated features to protect proprietary information, but the core problem remains representative of the complexities faced in real-world trading scenarios. The features and responses in the data are tied to market behavior, and my task was to develop a model that can effectively predict the desired outcome based on these inputs.

At Jane Street, machine learning models play a crucial role in supporting trading decisions across thousands of financial products in global markets. Through this project, I aimed to replicate a small aspect of the work done by their team, offering insights into the challenges of building models for trading strategies.
